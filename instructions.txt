--Setup Complete

5. The project is preconfigured with a number of 
npm helper scripts to make it easy to run the common 
tasks that you will need while developing:

 - npm start: Start a local development web server.
 - npm test: Start the Karma unit test runner.
 - npm run protractor: Run the Protractor end-to-end (E2E) tests.
 - npm run update-webdriver: Install the drivers needed by Protractor.

 ```

 ```
6. Install Hellper Tool (optional)
The Http-Server, Karma and Protractor modules are also 
executables, which can be installed globally and run 
directly from a terminal/command prompt. You don't need to
 do this to follow the tutorial, but if you decide you do
 want to run them directly, you can install these modules
 globally using,

cmd:  npm install --global http-server
